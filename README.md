My page recreation of a pre-made figma. Almost fully responsive.

Peer Reviewer: Angel Cuevas
Peer Review: Overal the website looks very much like the prototype website and the responsive was practically perfect the only thing was some of the responsiveness from the tablet leeked to the actual page but that an easy fix other that that i really like that in the tablet version theres one card with arrows that moves throught them witch i thought was a nice touch.
